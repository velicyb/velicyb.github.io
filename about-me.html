    <b>Hello</b>, I'm Vellamy Iris Cybette the I.<br>
    Or just Vel for short.<br>
    <br>
    I'm an <b>Applied Mathematician</b>, a <b>Philosopher</b>, and a <b>Metaverse Entrepreneur</b>.<br>
    <br>
    Since I was very young, I've been fascinated with both the systematic structure of mathematics,<br>
    and with the possibility of other worlds very unlike our own.<br>
    These days, I'm a <b>Modal Realist</b>, and spend part of my time studying <b>Computational Metaphysics</b> as part of a larger effort to establish contact with mathematically constructable realities beyond our own.<br>
    <br>
    Among my other talents and pursuits, I am a <b>Method Actor</b> and a pioneer of what I call <b>Ballardian Theatre</b>, a skill I make great use of in playing the role of my own <b>Metaverse Character</b><br>,
    in which I blur the lines of who I am with who my character is, opening the door to levels of immersive improv theatre and alternate reality gaming that were not previously possible.<br>
    <br>
    <b>In my 20s</b> I was lucky enough to have the means to employ myself in researching <b>new methods in advanced mathematics and philosophy</b>.<br>
    <b>In my 30s</b> my goal is to be among the vanguard of the <b>Metaverse</b>.<br>
    <br>
    Would you like to <b>join me?</b><br>
    <b>Email me at username gmail</b> with the title "Metaverse" or "Opportunity",<br>
    or just "Hello" if you think I'm neat and simply want to say hi.
