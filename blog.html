    I'm starting to feel like an emo clown.<br>
    If I'm honest about the type of person I am, I'm both intelligent and transparent to a fault.<br>
    If you're a potential employer and you're reading my personal blog for whatever reason, hi I guess.<br>
    My professional persona is that of a performance artist in case you haven't noticed. If you're looking for a boring programmer in a suit look elsewhere, I wouldn't want to work for someone with such a sour attitude anyways.<br>
    And yeah, I'm probably overqualified. Please consider I need work to keep myself sane more than I need the money.<br>
    With that out of the way, hi again I guess. I'm Vel, a not very good programmer and an excellent mathematician among other things.
