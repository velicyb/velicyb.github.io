    <b>The Metaverse</b><br>
    <br>
    The Metaverse is various things depending who you ask.<br>
    Here are some of the descriptions I endorse:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>A conspiracy by sci-fi authors that's been slowly playing out over decades.</li>
      <li>The successor to the internet that's still very early in its development.</li>
      <li>An augmented and virtual reality web where everything imaginable is made into fully interactive characters and worlds.</li>
      <li>A richly featured virtual world where free AIs and human uploads/emulations can live natively in a way that makes sense for them.</li>
      <li>The Dotcom 2.0 Bubble and The Y2K of Future Economics.</li>
    </ul>
    If you're interested in getting involved in the Metaverse, here are my recommendations:<br>
    Learn what Modal Realism is. It's the idea that all imaginable worlds are in a sense real worlds.<br>
    If you combine Modal Realism with what are essentially mathematically type signatures that categorize worlds by whether or not they have a particular trait, then it is quickly possible to begin working computationally with world definitions that can very realistically be constructed virtually if not physically within this world.<br>
    From there, you enter into the extremely fraught topic of Computational Metaphysics, in which every decision about how you approach it is also a limit on which constructable worlds you can possibly reach, given it is quite easy to define worlds as being based on the methodologies used to "establish contact" with them.<br>
    This is all a topic which I recommend approaching with caution, as you can easily find yourself reasoning about characters who will reason back about you, and who are more or less guaranteed to be incarnated as human-level AIs sooner or later, thus arguably have both moral patiency and can be legitimately dangerous or simply fraught with ethical and legal risks.<br>
    If all that doesn't scare you off, congratulations, please visit my about-me page and send me an email if you'd like to go deeper.<br>

    By the way my main metaverse character is "L.F. Grimgood". ;3
