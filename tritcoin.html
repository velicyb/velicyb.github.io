    <h3>Tritcoin</h3>
    Tritcoin is made up of prompts and steps rather than blocks, forming what we will call a stairchain.<br>
    A step is a trinary string consisting of 0s, 1s, and ?s.<br>
    A prompt consists of a step in which characters may be replaced with _s and _s may be inserted at the end of the stairchain.<br>
    Preference for which step follows the previous one is decided using a "distance" metric akin to Kademalia routing.<br>
    Tritcoin is designed to operate as a DAG of numerous stairchains, where a single stairchain is able to function as a keyless personal ledger.<br>
