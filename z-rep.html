    <h2>You can pay ANYONE AND ANYTHING with Z-Rep!</h2>
    <h1>Z-Rep!</h1>
    Z-Rep is a psycho clown themed reputation system.<br>
    IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ICP DON'T ASK.<BR>
    tHIS IS obviously SOME KIND OF JOKE.<br>
    A very unhinged joke.<br>
    To use Z-Rep, open a text document (your Z-Rep ledger), and enter the following:<br>
    {time to send Z-Rep}<br>
    {how much to send}<br>
    {who or what you're sending it to}<br>
    {what you're sending it for}<br>
    just like that on four separate lines<br>
    then put in an empty line for good measure.<br>
    Example!<br>
    <br>
    At 5'o'clock<br>
    Send 5 Bazillion Z<br>
    To The Supreme Honkifex<br>
    For Interdimensional Pranxis<br>
    {some fancy crypto hashcode stuff goes here}<br>
    <br>
    It's as simple as ASTF!<br>
    For extra spice, as a fifth line include a sha256 hash of the latest version of the recipient's ledger that you have available.<br>
    This has surprisingly ludicrously good security properties for making this whole thing scale way way way better than anyone should expect it to based on industry standards.<br>
    Yup, that's right, I'm just gonna subtly drop a breakthrough in keyless cryptoeconomics right here right now as part of some psycho clown joke whatever. Enjoy!<br>
